Plastic Chemicals Tests

Inspired by [Nat Friedman's tweet](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1789287484515659896).

### Initial ideas
- add / upvote goods to test
- link to plastic-free goods
- template to send your representative
- link to apply for a grant if you're researching this
- app to scan barcode & know how much plastic is in it / if it's safe to eat

### Collecting questions
- phthalates, bisphenols, PFAS, plastics, teflon - how are all of these related / mapped, what do we know about how dangerous / safe they are.
- most of our knowledge comes from studies. what makes a good study? c.f. [beware the man of one study](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/)
- how do they enter and leave our bodies.
- what happens when they are in our bodies.
- bans on PFAS, what do they mean.
- EPA banned PFAS starting in 2025. but it's likely there are similar chemicals that can be used to circumvent the ban. what is the root of the problem and how do we attack it?
from twitter:
- for those of us that ultimately can't rid ourselves of plastic packaging for a lot of our food sources, what levels of phthalates per serving should we be targeting?

### research notes

#### Plastics

- Almost all of us have plastics in our bodies.
  - https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1306681
- It is likely that plastics kill us. The process is likely slow but cumulative.
  - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10038118/
  - https://www.endocrine.org/topics/edc/plastics-edcs-and-health
- You likely cannot stop consuming plastics, because they are everywhere.
  - Plastics are widely used, directly and indirectly, in production, processing, and packaging of almost all food.
  - Plastics are also found in clothes, toys, furniture, receipts, household dust, and probably many more things.
- There are thousands of plastics that fall into many different groups. Some may be more harmful than others.
  - Plasticizers - make plastic more flexible and durable
    - Phthalates - most common plasticizers
      - DEHP - one of the most well-studied phthalates. Linked to insulin resistance, high blood pressure, reproductive issues, early menopause, and other concerns at levels well below the limits set by American and European regulators.

  - Bisphenols - other chemicals found in plastic
- We do not know what "safe levels" are, or if they even exist. It is likely that plastics are harmful at very low levels.
  - https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-021-00799-8
- American and European regulators are aware that plastics are harmful, but the limits they set on the use of plastics do not reflect the most current scientific knowledge and are dangerously high.
  - https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-021-00799-8
- Human body is good at eliminating at least some plastics (bisphenols and phthalates) from our systems. But because we are constantly exposed to plastics, we have them in our bodies at most times.
