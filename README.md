Plastic Chemicals Tests

Inspired by [Nat Friedman's tweet](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1789287484515659896).

add here what we know to date

initial ideas
- add / upvote goods to test
- link to plastic-free goods
- template to send your representative
- link to apply for a grant if you're researching this
- app to scan barcode & know how much plastic is in it / if it's safe to eat

collecting questions
- for those of us that ultimately can't rid ourselves of plastic packaging for a lot of our food sources, what levels of phthalates per serving should we be targeting?
